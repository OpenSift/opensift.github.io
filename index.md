# OpenSift 🧠⚡
**Sift faster. Study smarter.**

OpenSift is a **local-first AI study assistant** that helps students sift through large amounts of information (PDFs, websites, notes, books) to find what matters most — and turn it into:

- Study guides
- Key points & summaries
- Quizzes and practice questions
- Clear explanations grounded in your own materials

## Quick Links
- [Documentation](docs/index.md)
- [Quick Start](docs/quickstart.md)
- [Security](docs/security.md)
- [Providers (OpenAI / Claude / Claude Code)](docs/providers.md)

## What’s the core idea?
You ingest sources, then ask questions via a chatbot UI. OpenSift retrieves the most relevant passages (RAG) and generates outputs based on those passages.

> **Designed to run on localhost** with authentication and rate limiting enabled.
