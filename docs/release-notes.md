# OpenSift Release Notes

## v1.1.0-alpha (Proposed)
Release date: 2026-02-17

This release rounds out OpenSift from a proof-of-concept chatbot into a more complete student study app, with major improvements to launch flow, ingestion reliability, UI/UX, observability, and operational tooling.

### Highlights
- Added a unified OpenSift launcher with guided setup and gateway orchestration.
- Upgraded chat UI to a sidebar-first layout with persistent chat/session controls.
- Improved URL/PDF ingestion reliability for long and difficult documents.
- Added centralized, rotating logs across UI, terminal, launcher, and MCP server.
- Added CI pipeline and GitHub badges for release/build/license visibility.

### Added
- Guided setup workflow via `python opensift.py setup` for:
  - API/token configuration (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`)
  - saved local environment in `backend/.env`
  - launch mode selection (`gateway`, `ui`, `terminal`, `both`)
- Gateway runner via `python opensift.py gateway [--with-mcp]` with:
  - supervised child process lifecycle
  - startup `/health` checks and timeout handling
  - coordinated graceful shutdown and failure propagation
- Central logging utility in `backend/app/logging_utils.py`:
  - console + rotating file logs
  - configurable level, directory, retention, and file size
- Access logging middleware in UI API with request IDs and timing metrics.
- MCP server logging for ingest/search/generate tool execution paths.
- CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) for dependency checks, bytecode compile checks, and launcher smoke tests.
- Project badges in README:
  - build/smoke test status
  - release version
  - release date
  - MIT license

### Changed
- Chat UI updated to a more modern assistant-style interface:
  - left-side session history panel
  - larger main chat workspace
  - improved visual system (typography, spacing, panel hierarchy, gradients)
  - reduced modal friction for new chat flow (direct in-UI session creation path)
- Provider defaults updated:
  - OpenAI default model: `gpt-5.2`
  - Claude default model alias: `claude-sonnet-4-5`
- Vector store writes now use upsert semantics for safer repeat ingestion behavior.

### Ingestion and Reliability Improvements
- URL ingestion hardening in `backend/app/ingest.py`:
  - retry logic with backoff for fetch failures
  - robust HTML cleanup/noise stripping
  - main-content candidate scoring
  - fallback body extraction when structural parsing is weak
  - content normalization + max-length truncation safeguards
- PDF ingestion improvements:
  - scanned/low-text page detection
  - OCR pass from embedded PDF images
  - OCR fallback via `pdf2image` + Tesseract for difficult documents
  - merged OCR/plain extraction strategy for better recall
- Retrieval robustness:
  - owner-scoped query with fallback broader scan to recover missed owner matches

### Fixed
- Multiple ingestion edge paths that previously returned too little/empty content now have stronger fallbacks.
- Operational blind spots during failures are reduced through structured error logging and request tracing.
- Re-ingesting previously seen sources is less error-prone due to vector upsert behavior.

### Developer Experience
- Launcher now exposes clear command surface:
  - `setup`, `ui`, `terminal`, `gateway`
- README updated with:
  - gateway and setup usage
  - logging configuration variables
  - supported provider flow

### Configuration
New logging-related environment variables:
- `OPENSIFT_LOG_LEVEL` (default: `INFO`)
- `OPENSIFT_LOG_DIR` (default: `.opensift_logs`)
- `OPENSIFT_LOG_MAX_BYTES` (default: `5242880`)
- `OPENSIFT_LOG_BACKUP_COUNT` (default: `5`)

OCR-related note:
- Best OCR results require system/runtime OCR dependencies (`pytesseract` and optionally `pdf2image` + Poppler + Tesseract binaries).

### Upgrade Notes
- Existing users can continue with current `.env`; run `python opensift.py setup` to migrate into the guided flow.
- For gateway-supervised local runs, prefer:
  - `python opensift.py gateway --with-mcp`
- For logs on disk, ensure the configured log directory is writable.
